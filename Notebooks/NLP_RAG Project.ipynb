Such use is contrary to\\ninternational law and has rarely taken place during formal warfare in modern history, despite the extensive\\npreparations and stockpiling of biological agents carried out during the 20th century by most major\\npowers. For a variety of reasons (including uncertain military efficacy and the threat of massive\\nretaliation), experts consider the use of biological agents in formal warfare unlikely. The area of most\\nconcern is the use of such agents by terrorist groups. Biological agents are thought by some people to be\\nan ideal weapon for terrorists. These agents may be delivered clandestinely, and they have delayed\\neffects, allowing the user to remain undetected.\\nPotential biological agents include anthrax, botulinum toxin, brucellosis, encephalitis, viruses,\\nhemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola and Marburg), plague, tularemia, and smallpox. Each of these agents is\\npotentially fatal and, except for anthrax and botulinum toxin, can be passed from person to person.\\nAnthrax is of most concern; anthrax spores are relatively easy to prepare and spread through the air,\\ncreating the potential for distribution by airplane. Theoretically, 1 kg of anthrax could kill 10,000 people,\\nalthough technical difficulties with preparing the spores in a sufficiently fine powder would probably limit\\nactual deaths to a fraction of this number. Some other potential agents, including Yersinia pestis,\\nFrancisella tularensis, viral hemorrhagic fever viruses, smallpox virus, and botulinum toxin, can potentially\\nbe aerosolized as bioweapons.\\nDespite these theoretical concerns, the only successful terrorist use of anthrax—multiple pieces of\\ncontaminated mail delivered to a variety of locations in the US in 2001—resulted in only a handful of\\ndeaths and serious infections (total of 22 cases). A larger number of people were contaminated with\\nanthrax spores without developing illness. However, there was extreme public anxiety related to these\\nincidents, which may have been a major goal of the terror group responsible.\\nIn addition to the actual infections, an even greater number of false threats of anthrax have been\\nreported. In 1999, the FBI received an average of 1 false report/day of alleged anthrax use. False reports,\\nboth hoaxes and alarmed citizens misperceiving harmless material for anthrax, increased even more after\\nthe 2001 anthrax attack in the US.\\nThe only other successful use of a biological agent by a terror group in the US occurred in 1984. In this\\nevent, 751 people were stricken with diarrhea when a salad bar in Oregon was intentionally contaminated\\nwith Salmonella. The bacteria were introduced by a religious cult trying to influence the results of a local\\nelection. No one died, and the election was not affected.\\nDefense against bioterrorism involves several factors:\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 129.

       " Document(page_content='rate is ≥ 125 beats/min. ICU admission is required for patients who need mechanical ventilation and for\\nthose with hypotension (systolic BP < 90 mm Hg) that is unresponsive to volume resuscitation. Other\\ncriteria that mandate consideration for ICU admission include respiratory rate > 30/min, PaO2/fraction of\\ninspired O2 (FIO2) < 250, multilobar pneumonia, diastolic BP < 60 mm Hg, confusion, and BUN > 19.6\\nmg/dL.\\nAppropriate treatment involves starting antibiotics as soon as possible, preferably ≤ 8 h after presentation.\\nSupportive care includes fluids, antipyretics, analgesics, and, for patients with hypoxemia, O2.\\nBecause organisms are difficult to identify, antibiotics are selected based on likely pathogens and severity\\nof illness. Consensus guidelines have been developed by many professional organizations; one widely\\nused set is detailed in Table 196-2. Guidelines should be adapted to local susceptibility patterns, drug\\nformularies, and individual patient circumstances. Importantly, none provide recommendations for\\ntreatment of viral pneumonia.\\nRibavirin and RSV Ig have been used alone and in combination for RSV bronchiolitis in children, but their\\neffectiveness is controversial, and neither is standard practice. Ribavirin is not used in adults with RSV\\ninfection.\\n[Table 196-4. Risk Stratification for Community-Acquired Pneumonia]\\nOseltamivir 75 mg po bid or zanamivir 10 mg inhaled bid started within 48 h of symptom onset and given\\nfor 5 days reduces the duration and severity of symptoms in patients who develop influenza infection.\\nAcyclovir 5 to 10 mg/kg IV q 8 h for adults or 250 to 500 mg/m2 body surface area IV q 8 h for children is\\nrecommended for varicella lung infections. Some patients with viral pneumonia, especially those with\\ninfluenza, develop superimposed bacterial infections and require antibiotics directed against S.\\npneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus.\\nWith empiric treatment, 90% of patients with bacterial pneumonia improve. Improvement is manifested by\\ndecreased cough and dyspnea, defervescence, relief of chest pain, and decline in WBC count. Failure to\\nimprove should trigger suspicion of an unusual organism, resistance to the antimicrobial used for\\ntreatment, empyema, coinfection or superinfection with a 2nd infectious agent, an obstructive\\nendobronchial lesion, immunosuppression, metastatic focus of infection with reseeding (in the case of\\npneumococcal infection), or nonadherence to treatment (in the case of outpatients). If none of these can\\nbe proved, treatment failure is likely due to inadequate host defenses.\\nMost viral pneumonias resolve without specific treatment.\\nChest physical therapy can be used to treat pneumonia; however, there is no clear evidence for its\\nefficacy. Follow-up x-rays should be obtained 6 wk after treatment in patients > 35; persistence of an\\ninfiltrate at ≥ 6 wk raises suspicions of an underlying, possibly malignant endobronchial lesion or of TB.\\nPrevention\\nSome forms of community-acquired pneumonia are preventable with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine\\n(for patients < 2 yr), H. influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine (for patients < 2 yr), pneumococcal pneumonia\\nvaccine (for patients at high risk, such as those with underlying heart, lung, or immune system disorders),\\nvaricella vaccine (for patients < 18 mo and a later booster vaccine), and influenza vaccine (for patients\\nage ≥ 65 and those at high risk—see\\nTable 131-2 on p. 1174 and see\\nTable 268-10 on p. 2718). Oseltamivir 75 mg po once/day or zanamivir 10 mg once/day can be given for 2\\nwk to prevent influenza (although resistance has recently been described for oseltamivir) for household\\ncontacts of patients with influenza and to high-risk patients not vaccinated against influenza during\\ninfluenza epidemics.

Each of these agents is\\npotentially fatal and, except for anthrax and botulinum toxin, can be passed from person to person.\\nAnthrax is of most concern; anthrax spores are relatively easy to prepare and spread through the air,\\ncreating the potential for distribution by airplane. Theoretically, 1 kg of anthrax could kill 10,000 people,\\nalthough technical difficulties with preparing the spores in a sufficiently fine powder would probably limit\\nactual deaths to a fraction of this number. Some other potential agents, including Yersinia pestis,\\nFrancisella tularensis, viral hemorrhagic fever viruses, smallpox virus, and botulinum toxin, can potentially\\nbe aerosolized as bioweapons.\\nDespite these theoretical concerns, the only successful terrorist use of anthrax—multiple pieces of\\ncontaminated mail delivered to a variety of locations in the US in 2001—resulted in only a handful of\\ndeaths and serious infections (total of 22 cases). A larger number of people were contaminated with\\nanthrax spores without developing illness. However, there was extreme public anxiety related to these\\nincidents, which may have been a major goal of the terror group responsible.\\nIn addition to the actual infections, an even greater number of false threats of anthrax have been\\nreported. In 1999, the FBI received an average of 1 false report/day of alleged anthrax use. False reports,\\nboth hoaxes and alarmed citizens misperceiving harmless material for anthrax, increased even more after\\nthe 2001 anthrax attack in the US.\\nThe only other successful use of a biological agent by a terror group in the US occurred in 1984. In this\\nevent, 751 people were stricken with diarrhea when a salad bar in Oregon was intentionally contaminated\\nwith Salmonella. The bacteria were introduced by a religious cult trying to influence the results of a local\\nelection. No one died, and the election was not affected.\\nDefense against bioterrorism involves several factors:\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 129.

       " Document(page_content='rate is ≥ 125 beats/min. ICU admission is required for patients who need mechanical ventilation and for\\nthose with hypotension (systolic BP < 90 mm Hg) that is unresponsive to volume resuscitation. Other\\ncriteria that mandate consideration for ICU admission include respiratory rate > 30/min, PaO2/fraction of\\ninspired O2 (FIO2) < 250, multilobar pneumonia, diastolic BP < 60 mm Hg, confusion, and BUN > 19.6\\nmg/dL.\\nAppropriate treatment involves starting antibiotics as soon as possible, preferably ≤ 8 h after presentation.\\nSupportive care includes fluids, antipyretics, analgesics, and, for patients with hypoxemia, O2.\\nBecause organisms are difficult to identify, antibiotics are selected based on likely pathogens and severity\\nof illness. Consensus guidelines have been developed by many professional organizations; one widely\\nused set is detailed in Table 196-2. Guidelines should be adapted to local susceptibility patterns, drug\\nformularies, and individual patient circumstances. Importantly, none provide recommendations for\\ntreatment of viral pneumonia.\\nRibavirin and RSV Ig have been used alone and in combination for RSV bronchiolitis in children, but their\\neffectiveness is controversial, and neither is standard practice. Ribavirin is not used in adults with RSV\\ninfection.\\n[Table 196-4. Risk Stratification for Community-Acquired Pneumonia]\\nOseltamivir 75 mg po bid or zanamivir 10 mg inhaled bid started within 48 h of symptom onset and given\\nfor 5 days reduces the duration and severity of symptoms in patients who develop influenza infection.\\nAcyclovir 5 to 10 mg/kg IV q 8 h for adults or 250 to 500 mg/m2 body surface area IV q 8 h for children is\\nrecommended for varicella lung infections. Some patients with viral pneumonia, especially those with\\ninfluenza, develop superimposed bacterial infections and require antibiotics directed against S.\\npneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus.\\nWith empiric treatment, 90% of patients with bacterial pneumonia improve. Improvement is manifested by\\ndecreased cough and dyspnea, defervescence, relief of chest pain, and decline in WBC count. Failure to\\nimprove should trigger suspicion of an unusual organism, resistance to the antimicrobial used for\\ntreatment, empyema, coinfection or superinfection with a 2nd infectious agent, an obstructive\\nendobronchial lesion, immunosuppression, metastatic focus of infection with reseeding (in the case of\\npneumococcal infection), or nonadherence to treatment (in the case of outpatients). If none of these can\\nbe proved, treatment failure is likely due to inadequate host defenses.\\nMost viral pneumonias resolve without specific treatment.\\nChest physical therapy can be used to treat pneumonia; however, there is no clear evidence for its\\nefficacy. Follow-up x-rays should be obtained 6 wk after treatment in patients > 35; persistence of an\\ninfiltrate at ≥ 6 wk raises suspicions of an underlying, possibly malignant endobronchial lesion or of TB.\\nPrevention\\nSome forms of community-acquired pneumonia are preventable with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine\\n(for patients < 2 yr), H. influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine (for patients < 2 yr), pneumococcal pneumonia\\nvaccine (for patients at high risk, such as those with underlying heart, lung, or immune system disorders),\\nvaricella vaccine (for patients < 18 mo and a later booster vaccine), and influenza vaccine (for patients\\nage ≥ 65 and those at high risk—see\\nTable 131-2 on p. 1174 and see\\nTable 268-10 on p. 2718). Oseltamivir 75 mg po once/day or zanamivir 10 mg once/day can be given for 2\\nwk to prevent influenza (although resistance has recently been described for oseltamivir) for household\\ncontacts of patients with influenza and to high-risk patients not vaccinated against influenza during\\ninfluenza epidemics. Pneumococcal pneumonia vaccination is recommended for all patients ≥ 65 (see p.\\n1177).\\nHospital-Acquired Pneumonia\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 196.

    "####Based on the analysis and the implemented RAG system, here are some actionable insights and business recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actionable Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adding Trusted Sources Improves Accuracy**: Integrating a RAG approach with trusted medical references, like the Merck Manual, clearly improves the quality of answers for specific medical questions. Compared to a base language model, this setup produces responses that are more reliable and relevant, highlighting the value of providing vetted context for medical queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fine-Tuning Helps Adjust the Tone and Detail**: Modifying the temperature parameter has a clear impact on how responses are phrased. Keeping it low (around 0) results in more consistent and cautious answers, while a moderate setting (such as 0.5) allows for more natural variation in wording while still respecting the facts. The right setting depends on how much nuance or conservativeness is needed for different types of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Good Context Retrieval Drives Better Grounding**: The evaluation shows that the accuracy of answers depends heavily on how closely the retrieved text matches the user’s question. This means that careful tuning of the retriever and vector store is essential to ensure that the information the system draws from stays relevant and factual.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **A Clear System Prompt Reinforces Safe Use**: The system prompt used here does its job well by steering the model to act as a responsible assistant — it avoids stepping into diagnosis or treatment advice and always reminds users to consult a qualified doctor. This layer of guidance is vital for keeping the tool safe and trustworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chunking Strategy Matters**: Using a chunk size of 1,000 tokens with a 200-token overlap works well for pulling meaningful information from the Merck Manual. That said, it’s worth testing different chunk sizes and overlaps for other medical sources to find the best balance between context coverage and retrieval precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Put the RAG Tool into Daily Practice**: Roll out the RAG-based AI as an internal support tool for medical staff. It can be connected to Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems or offered through a secure web or mobile app to make it easy to access during daily workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Broaden the Reference Material**: While the Merck Manual is an excellent foundation, expanding the knowledge base to include clinical guidelines, medical journals, and specialty textbooks will strengthen the assistant’s usefulness and depth of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gather User Feedback Continuously**: Build in a simple way for medical staff to rate responses or flag anything unclear. This feedback loop will help keep the AI’s answers accurate and aligned with users’ needs over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Design a User-Friendly Interface**: Develop an interface that makes it easy to ask and refine questions. Features like auto-suggestions, keyword highlights in retrieved text, or the option to add more context can help clinicians get more precise answers quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Start with High-Impact Areas**: Focus the initial rollout on specific situations where quick, reliable information is most valuable — for example, supporting emergency room teams, primary care doctors, or specialty clinics. This phased approach allows for careful testing and adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prioritize Privacy and Compliance**: Medical information is highly sensitive, so any deployment must meet strict security and privacy standards like HIPAA. Make sure data is processed and stored securely and that the system is built to comply with all relevant regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Track Use and Improve**: Keep an eye on how the system performs — monitor response times, check accuracy through periodic expert reviews, and measure how widely it’s used. These insights will highlight where refinements are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Plan for Future Upgrades**: Once the core system is stable, look into adding new capabilities. Possibilities include accepting images (with careful disclaimers), providing concise summaries, connecting to diagnostic support tools (while clearly stating it doesn’t replace medical judgment), or customizing answers by role or specialty to make the information even more useful."
